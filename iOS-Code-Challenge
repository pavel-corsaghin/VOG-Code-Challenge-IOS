Note: Authentication is done with an JWT authentication token. Assume you have a valid token.

1. On or before the view is loaded a mock network call will be made to retrieve the profile Information
    The endpoint is "https://api.foo.com/profiles/mine
    JSON return is in the following format:
    {
        "message": "User Retrieved",
        "data":
        {
            "firstName": "Johnny B",
            "userName": "iOS User",
            "lastName": "Goode"
        }
    }

2. Both "Save Changes" buttons will make a mock network call to the following endpoints:
    Basic Information: POST "https://api.foo.com/profiles/update"
    - required parameters: firstName, lastName
    - successful return will be in the format of:
    {
        "message": "User Retrieved",

            "firstName": "Johnny B",
            "userName": "iOS User",
            "lastName": "Goode"
        }
    }
